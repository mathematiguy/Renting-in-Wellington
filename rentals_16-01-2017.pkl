V1 bedroom apartment with 1 bathroom.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This flat has now been leased and I will notify all applicants separately by email. Thank you all for your interest+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Thanks to everyone who attended the open home and submitted an application. I will be in touch as soon as I have processed all the applications which is likely to be prior to 17th January.Charming one bedroom apartment with separate lounge off kitchen/dining area. Recently renovated, with a Heat Pump installed  in 2016Very close to Kelburn village, Uni, and the city.Lovely afternoon sun with a small deck area at front of apartment and french doors to make the most of it.A quiet neighborhood with native trees and birds makes this apartment a delight to come home to.Demand for this apartment has historically been very strong.The lease is a 1 year fixed term lease starting as close as possible to 23rd January and running to 22nd January next year. Conditions of the lease are no pets, no smokers, and no sub-letting.4 weeks bond and one week's rent is required in advance for the successful applicant to confirm the tenancy.There is no letting fee so move in costs are $1650.It would be helpful but not essential if letters from referees (from previous tenancies) could be included with the application.There is a new heat pump in the lounge and I plan to install a HRV/DVS system in the bedroom soon.Suitable for up to 2 tenants.No pets or smokers.
