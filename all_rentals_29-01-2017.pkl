V2 bedroom apartment with 1 bathroom.Cute, quiet, sunny, unfurnished city apartment with spectacular views, garage and workshop, and a real X-factor.This compact two-bedroom (or spacious one-bedroom with study) top-level apartment has picture postcard views overlooking Oriental Bay, Wellington harbour and out to the Tararuas - with views back to Waitangi Park. The elevated aspect of the apartment means you see the traffic down on the bay but can\u2019t hear any of it. Planes glide over the harbour and vanish behind Roseneath, the fountain does its thing, the night time lights are wonderful.It also has all day sun.It\u2019s a mere five minutes walk to Oriental Bay and beach, or a lazy ten-minute stroll down to Courtenay Place.

V2 bedroom house with 1 bathroom.Newly renovated villa with great afternoon sun,  indoor-outdoor flow and backyard.

One large bedroom with bay window overlooking backyard, and one smaller room (it can fit a double bed, just). Big french doors open from living room out into back yard. It's the downstairs of a two bedroom house. Because of the smaller second bedroom this is ideal for a couple, or a couple with a child (as per current tenants). Wouldn't suit 3 adults.If you are interested in viewing please email me with your name and details (eg how many of you, what you do).Suitable for up to 3 tenants.Pets negotiable, no smokers.

V1 bedroom unit with 1 bathroom.I am all full up for the open homes now, but will post details for another if it doesn't go this weekend. CHEERS! Are you looking for an amazing, sunny flat just minutes from the CBD? I am reluctantly leaving this flat as I am moving overseas, but my loss is your gain!Important details: the property has a lovely private landlord, who is overseas until the end of January. The flat is available from 13 February 2017. If you are interested, please come along to an open home. If you like what you see, I'll get you to send me some information about yourself, and some reference information. You will need to be available during lunchtime on the 2nd or 3rd of February to meet the landlord, and we will move quickly to sign the lease from there.The flat is one of three in sunny Wadestown, and has its own private entrance, deck and lockable single garage. As the top flat, it looks out over the bush, and is very quiet - you can often hear visiting Tuis from Otari-Wiltons bush. It has a large double bedroom with double wardrobe, and a spacious combined lounge/kitchen with dishwasher.The flat is tidy, with a modernised kitchen and bathroom. There is a panel heater in the bedroom, but I have never needed to use it. My average monthly power bill since moving in is $70 per month. It is currently wired for ADSL broadband.There is a bus stop (14) 5 minutes from your door, and the drive to the Terrace takes about 7 minutes. The bus to Lambton Quay takes 15 mins. You are also 1km from Crofton Downs railway station/countdown/pharmacy, and in the other direction, the Wadestown shops. The entrance to Otago-Wiltons bush is about 2 minutes away.The house is unfurnished, but as I am moving overseas, I have 2x bookcases, a set of drawers and a bedside table for sale - just make me a reasonable offer. I can also leave the fridge for $300 and a washer for $100, if needed. These are both modern and in good working order, no issues.One cat allowed.Don't miss out on this one - flats like this don't come up often!Suitable for up to 2 tenants.Pets OK, no smokers.

V2 bedroom house with 1 bathroom.A couple have taken the house and are looking for another couple to join them. Enquiries will be forwarded to them.Warm sunny flat, one of two, in a quiet street close to the Terrace.Clean, tidy and well maintained. The paint is the same throughout and fairly neutral (Resene Pearl Lusta).There is a large private deck off the lounge which is solely for this flat's use.There is one carpark. Tenants can let this out, it currently fetches $40 per week.The ceilings, floor and walls are insulated - the flat was built in 1998 in a villa style to match the original villa at the front.While close to the city and university, the neighbourhood is quiet and many of the houses are family homes. The house would therefore not suit if you like to party or have large groups of friends visit.No letting feePets negotiable, no smokers.
