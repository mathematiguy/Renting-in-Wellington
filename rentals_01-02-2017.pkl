Bathroom, lounge and mezzanine room recently painted with recently new drapes in the lounge.Looking for some quiet reading time - the library is a 5 minute walk down the road and Queensgate is less than 10 minutes drive in case you need some major shopping therapy.But wait there's more activities to look forward to!  A 10 minute walk will lead you to the Hutt Park Golf Course or even stroll a bit further and you're at Jungle Rama and the Hutt Park Indoor Sports Centre.
